# PLS by Taranasus

## TL;DR

**PLS** is a powerful CLI tool that translates natural language into shell commands, executing them instantly. Perfect for quickly navigating your filesystem, managing files, or executing complex commands without having to remember the exact syntax.

### Example

Command:
```
pls zip all files in the current directory that contain the word "report" and save to desktop
```

Output:
```
[LLAMA] zip ~/Desktop/reports.zip ./*report*
[Total Cost: $0.000001]
```

Command:
```
pls

SUP? : tell me what os i'm using
```

Output:
```
[LLAMA] sw_vers
ProductName:		macOS
ProductVersion:		14.6.1
BuildVersion:		23G93
[Total Cost: $0.000001]
```

This single command zips all files in your current directory containing the word "report" and saves the resulting archive to your desktop—all without manually constructing the `zip` command yourself.

## Long Description

PLS (Please) is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that translates natural language into shell commands for macOS. While it's primarily designed for macOS, it might work on Linux too, although this hasn't been tested. PLS is based on [MxDkl/pls](https://github.com/MxDkl/pls), with enhancements to better suit specific needs.

This is a high-risk version that does not wait for validation of the command you've requested—it will run immediately. Use with care, especially when running as root.

By default, PLS uses Llama 3.2 1B Instruct to generate commands, which provides fast and accurate responses at very low cost. You can use Gemini 2.0 Flash by using the `-a` flag for more complex queries.

## Features
- Translate natural language commands directly into shell commands
- Execute commands immediately, without confirmation
- Supports macOS and potentially Linux (not tested)
- Includes debugging mode for inspecting API responses
- Uses OpenRouter API for flexible model selection and cost-effective operation

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
To install PLS, clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/taranasus/pls.git
```

### Create a Token File
1. Navigate to the cloned repository folder:
   ```
   cd pls
   ```
2. Create a file named `token.txt` in the root of the repository:
   ```
   touch token.txt
   ```
3. Add your OpenRouter API key to this file:
   - Get your API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
   - Open the `token.txt` file in a text editor
   - Paste your OpenRouter API key into the file
   - Save and close the file

### Make the Script Executable
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the repository.
2. Make the script executable by running:
   ```
   chmod +x pls
   ```

### Add the Folder to Your PATH
1. Still in the terminal, run the following command to add the repository folder to your system's `PATH` environment variable, making `pls` runnable from any folder:
   ```
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:'$(pwd) >> ~/.bash_profile
   ```
2. Reload your terminal session to apply the changes:
   ```
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

## Requirements
- **jq**: A command-line JSON processor. You can install it using `brew` on macOS or your preferred package manager:
  ```
  brew install jq
  ```
- **OpenRouter API key**: Obtain an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) and place it in a file named `token.txt` as described above.

## Usage
To use PLS, simply type your natural language command after the `pls` command:
```
> pls [natural language command]
```

### Example Commands
```
pls list all files in the current directory
pls list all files in the current directory that contain "foo"
pls make a directory called "foo" with 3 files in it that each have 1000 random words
pls use iptables to forward all traffic from port 80 to port 8501
pls zip all files in the current directory that contain the word "foo" and save to desktop
```

### Example Output
```
taranasus@taranasus-MacBook-Air _Unsorted % pls give me a total filecount including subfolders
[LLAMA] find . -type f | wc -l
   21884
[Total Cost: $0.000001]
```

The output format is as follows:
- `[LLAMA]` or `[GEMINI]`: The language model used to generate the command
- The shell command generated by the tool
- The result of executing the command
- `[Total Cost: $x]`: The actual cost incurred to run the command

### Flags
- **-a**: Use Gemini 2.0 Flash instead of the default Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model
  ```
  pls -a [natural language command]
  ```
- **-q**: Query mode, where you can simply ask the AI a question and it will answer you directly in the terminal
  ```
  pls -q [natural language query]
  ```
- **-d**: Enable debug mode, which prints out the full JSON response from OpenRouter instead of executing the command
  ```
  pls -d [natural language command]
  ```
- You can combine the `-a` and `-d` flags:
  ```
  pls -a -d [natural language command]
  ```

## Warning
- **Caution**: This tool runs commands immediately and does not wait for user confirmation. Be especially careful when running commands as root, as it could execute destructive actions.
